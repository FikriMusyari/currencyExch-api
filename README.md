# Currency Exchange

This template provides a minimal setup for getting React working with Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some basic ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

## Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available for React projects:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**  
  This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh, allowing for a smooth development experience.

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**  
  This plugin uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, offering improved performance for large projects.

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, itâ€™s still a good practice to ensure your JavaScript code adheres to best practices by using ESLint rules. The current setup already includes basic ESLint configurations.

If you prefer to extend the ESLint configuration, you can easily customize it in the `.eslintrc.js` file.
